# Sprint 3 retrospective meeting

### Attendees: 
Karolina Tchilinguirova, Abhinaya Kondi, Christie Tang, Joshua Huliganga 

## Finished/Unfinished Tasks

All four of our user stores were completed in full:


    [7.0 story pts] As Alex(manager), I want to create an account and log in so that I can securely access my personalized settings and data

    [10.0 story pts] As Sara(student), I want the ability to customize my reports using personalized priority and lengths of time.  I like to be reminded of events far in the future if they are very important and want to customize my reports

    [10.0 story pts]As Alex(manager), I want to be emailed my report (notification feature) because I already start my day with checking my inbox and having my report in my inbox saves me time + I do not need to remember to open RollCall.

    [6.00 story pts]As Sara(student), I want to be able to share my report with my partner because I am very busy and it is easier to plan time to spend together if my schedule is clearly outlined without me having to explain when I am available.



## Practices that should continue during next sprint
- Good team communication on discord
    - We were all engaged and present on discord and in team meetings. 
    - Responsive and engaged members
    - All members responded with 24 hours and no teammates ghosted

- Asking for help and providing it when needed.
- Good use of the trello

## Practices that NOT should continue during next sprint
- Not sticking to the designated git naming rules
- Not procrastinating

## Harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Non consistent nomenclature for git commits
- Moving forward we should stick to git commit messages being structured as 
    - "ticket number -- description" 
    - "00 -- description" for minor or unrelated commits

## Sprint Highs
- Seeing and demoing our prototype at the end of the sprint
- Scrum is a rewarding management process

## Sprint Lows
- Merging code conflicts is challenging and merging tools are confusing to learn
- Having to rush tasks at the end
