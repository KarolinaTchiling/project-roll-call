# Sprint 2 Meeting

### Attendees: 
Karolina Tchilinguirova, Abhinaya Kondi, Christie Tang, Joshua Huliganga 

### Sprint Goal:
In this sprint we will focus on the backend development as we have the preliminary frontend built which will be able to display the features we plan to implement.  

By the end of this sprint we aim:
- develop the prioritization logic required to create a "Future at a glance" output 
- display the "Future at a glance" output on the frontend "Today" page
- develop the logic required to create a suggested TODO list
- display the TODO on the frontend "Today" page
- Implement the ability to check off elements in the TODO list
- Utilize Gemini API to generate a *Word of the Day* and *Quote of the Day*
- display the Word/Quote of the day on the frontend "Today" page


### Stories to be completed (On Trello: Sprint 2 Backlog):

|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8.5          | As Rachel (parent), I want a “Future at a glance” feature that highlights my further-reaching events because my children have appointments which are planned weeks in advance and they always sneak up on me. |
| 2.0          | As Sara (student), I like to be able to check off items from my TODO list because it is satisfying and motivating. |
| 9.0          | As Sara (student), I want a “Suggested TODO list” that automatically generates based on my scheduled events, helping me prioritize my tasks for the day. |
| 5.0          | As Alex (manager), I want to be displayed a motivational quote because my job is high stress and it will remind me to stay focused and be a good leader. And I want to be displayed a word of the day because it is a fun feature which will motivate me to check RollCall every day. |
